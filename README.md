# InnateMoisture-CropCultivationMappings


This project explores the relationship between the suffiency of Moisture content present in soils with the  suitability of crop that can be grown in that region..Machine learning Algorithms are implemeted to tackle this relationship and classify the crops according to the given parameters...
The work considers Soil Moisture,Muriate Of Potash(M.O.P) and TripleSuperPhosphate(T.S.P) as the base parameters for mapping along with the common parameters such as pH,Urea,Temprature etc...
